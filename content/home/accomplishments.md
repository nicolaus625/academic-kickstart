In response, the Chinese Music Institute at PKU, together with PKU Chinese orchestra, performed <a href='https://music.163.com/#/song?id=1806084008' target='_blank'>an excerpt of it</a>. It is adapted as a trio for Dizi, clarinet and flute. Compared to Beethoven's rigorous masterpiece, this cheerful work is relatively playful, and I hope that it will encourage all of you to overcome the difficulties of the times while remembering the great composer.
