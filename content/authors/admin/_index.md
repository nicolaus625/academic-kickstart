MA Yinghao (马英浩) is a master student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), majoring in Music and Technology. 
His research interests are signal processing and machine learning for computational listening, including music information retrieval, speech, sound event, along with multimodal related to them. 
Besides, he was one of student conductors of Chinese Philharmonic Orchestra, 
Chinese Music Institute at PKU (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Peking-University-Chinese-Music-Institute-cmipku-709151079161865/?ref=bookmarks" target="_blank">see at Facebook</a>). 
He is also an advocate of charitable activities (see at [other experience](#experience)).

He is now seeking for a PhD position to develop new and better objective criteria for speech and music analysis to pave the way for a deeper understanding of auditory phenomenon.

<!--He is now applying for Graduate studies, in pursuit of his passion in exploring new things and innovating new ideas.-->
