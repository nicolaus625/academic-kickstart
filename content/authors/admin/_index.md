MA Yinghao (马英浩) is an AI Music Ph.D. student at Centre for Digital Music (C4DM), School of EECS, Queen Mary University of London. <!-- His research interests include machine learning (especially self-supervised learning, SSL) and signal processing for music information retrieval (MIR) and  multimodal learning. --> 
He is one of the co-founders of the Multimodal Art Projection (<a href="https://m-a-p.ai/" target="_blank">MAP</a>) community.
Together with his colleague, he proposed an acoustic Music undERstanding model with large-scale self-supervised Training (MERT), with more than 50k downloads on the <a href="https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/" target="_blank">Huggingfac page</a>, and established a Music Audio Representation Benchmark for universaL Evaluation (<a href="https://marble-bm.sheffield.ac.uk/" target="_blank">MRABLE</a>). 
He is also interested in music-related multimodality and developed <a href="https://github.com/zihaod/MusiLingo" target="_blank">MusiLingo</a>, a music captioning and query response model based on the alignment of single-modality pre-trained models.

Besides, he was one of student conductors of Chinese Philharmonic Orchestra, 
Chinese Music Institute at Peking University (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Peking-University-Chinese-Music-Institute-cmipku-709151079161865/?ref=bookmarks" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a>). 
He is also an advocate of charitable activities (see at [other experience](#experience)).

He is now seeking for a summer internship position on SSL for MIR or music-related multimodality, in order to pave the way for a human understanding of music phenomenon. <!--He is now applying for Graduate studies, in pursuit of his passion in exploring new things and innovating new ideas.-->
